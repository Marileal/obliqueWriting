# obliqueWriting

This series was born out of an error I made in my coding practice in 2019. At the moment I intended to make a brush that imitated the simple black stroke of the broad edge nib, but the model I embedded in the code was wrong. Wrong in the best sense, as it gave me a very sensitive brush, that reacted to the variations of my gestures in a way the broad edge nib didn't. The quicker my gesture, less definite the stroke is. 

Made entirely on Processing, these images are results of random selections between 13 passages of my diaries rewritten in this brush. These sentences are my memories, my deep existential questions, my everyday problems, elements that compose my identity. My constant process of re-elaboration of these questions is suggested by this rewriting and the reappearance of some phrases along the series.

These passages don't let themselves be read easily. Their reading is slippery as the strokes that make them have no clear boundary and the random positioning of the sentences make them accumulate in layers over the same area. This strategy of not being clearly decoded may be a way to protect oneself, as clear visibility may be dangerous at times.
